Might make it more interesting. </p>\n<p>I didn't do a lot of tinkering with my lab as I've been busy with family, but I've got a lot of plans with containers and services to start running. I've also gotten a Content Management System (CMS) for creating my website and uploading it easier. The only thing I really need is time so I can get things put together. I suppose that's the key hang up that everyone runs in to.</p>\n<p>More to come.</p>",
