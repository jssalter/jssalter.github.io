More like you'll work every day because you'll want to do it for play as well as for pay.</p>\n<p>Trying to get services going in my stack and sometimes it's easy as cake, sometimes it's difficult as pie where you have to make the crust, filling, butter, and even pie tin from scratch. Some days you have an oven if you're lucky.</p>\n<p>I suppose I should make some guides for the more complicated of my setup here. Maybe I'll make a section for that someday. I should also make a \"to do\" as a section so people can see where this is going to go. </p>\n<p>Anyway, for this update: more services are going and more are being added. I'm going to try and focus, mostly, on easy wins so that I can have a more impressive stack. Once that's built up I can shift focus to things that didn't work the first time. Before I do that, however, I need to make sure that I'm getting a few things which I have priority for. Super important things like Floatplane Downloader. </p>\n<p>Talked today with my partner about doing bug bounties for some extra income. Having playgrounds like I do is a good start to that, I think, but I wonder how tough it is to get paid for all that. I'm assuming it won't be so easy. Maybe I'll find out.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I need to be better about consistency with updating here. Among other things.</p>\n<p>Doing homelab work while also working and having two kids kinda takes a lot of effort. I'm planning to have a VM with some AI assistance in the coming days to hopefully get things going quicker. So far dealing with Proxmox PCI passthrough has been an unnecessary pain in the dick. Passthrough to a VM is rather trivial, but passthrough to a container requires a PHD in Proxmoxology. Even following guides from Proxmox and others I couldn't get it to work properly. Ah well, soon I hope. </p>\n<p>In the past year I've had to reflash my entire lab stack. When I did that there were two computers that didn't come back. Rather than try to fix them I e-wasted them which isn't preferable, but I have to be realistic about the amount of time I'd have to invest and how worth it that investment would end up being considering those two computers were both around ten years old. </p>\n<p>Currently my lab has 4 nodes, 3 VMs, and 14 containers. Another 34 services are planned and will hopefully be along soon. I'd like to have 40+ services when I give my homelab presentation. </p>\n<p>In order for the next steps: AI service, Linkedin connection with this website, and add on more and more services. </p>\n<p>Then I'll have to update more often than once a year. </p>",

I've also gotten a Content Management System (CMS) for creating my website and uploading it easier. The only thing I really need is time so I can get things put together. I suppose that's the key hang up that everyone runs in to.</p>\n<p>More to come.</p>",
