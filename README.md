# Why

2024-10-22 <br>
For some reason my site here went down and I still can't seem to get my certificates for it working again.<br>
Got certificates working at home for all my services, so at least that's cool. Certbot doesn't seem to always want to renew when it should. Something for another day.<br>
Ah well. Hopefully fixing this site won't take very long - it took ten minutes after this post

# Holy shit

2024-06-09 <br>
I got certificates working in my home! I know it's not the most complicated of things to most people, but it's huge for me. <br>
Being able to access things with trusted and auto-renewing certs is something that'll make going forward with my homelab easier.

# Finally; some progress

2024-05-25 <br>
Looks like I got TLS and my unique domain working. Between home life and other challenges this has taken quite a bit, but it's there. 
<br>
Next up: I need certs for my internal domain/network

# Coming Soon

2024-03-18<br>
More will be made once I figure it out. Stay tuned
